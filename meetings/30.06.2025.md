# Meeting Summary: Patent Processing Pipeline Development

**Date**: 07, 07, 2025
**Attendees**: Project Lead

---

## **1. Project Goal Progress**

- **Structured Chunking**: Patent-specific text segmentation (claims, descriptions)
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Entity/relation extraction for technical understanding
- **Metadata Standardization**: Consistent schema for downstream tasks
- **Preparation for PatentBERT**: Data structuring for transformer-based classification

---

## **2. Technical Implementation**

### **Recent Development Highlights**

1. **Patent Chunking System**:
   - Configurable splitters (spaCy, SentenceTransformers, Recursive)
   - Special claim handling with number preservation
   - Metadata inheritance for chunk traceability

2. **Knowledge Graph Pipeline**:
   - Hybrid approach: spaCy (entities) + DSPy/LLM (relations)
   - Boundary-aware chunk processing for large documents
   - Pandas DF output for graph DB integration

3. **Data Modeling**:
   - `LangChainPatentMetadata`: 19-field schema with null handling
   - `LangChainPatentContent`: Standardized section mapping
   - Pydantic validators for data integrity

4. **Document Conversion**:
   - Beanie-to-LangChain transformer
   - Async batch processing
   - Memory-optimized streaming



### **Key Components Implemented**

1. **Patent-Specific Chunking**:
   - Claims as independent semantic units
   - Configurable overlap for technical continuity
   - Positional metadata for citation reference

2. **Knowledge Extraction**:
   - Context-aware entity linking
   - Patent-specific relation taxonomy:
     `material_of, method_step, component_of, improves`

## **3. Research**

Reviewed resources to address core challenges among other are:

1. **[PatentBERT Implementation](https://github.com/jiehsheng/PatentBERT)**
   - *Why*: Look at the implementation of PatenBERT
   - *Application*: Preparing metadata for fine-tuning

2. **[DSPy for KG Relations](https://aliirz.com/building-knowledge-graphs-using-dspy)**
   - *Why*: Replace fragile prompt engineering
   - *Insight*: Chain-of-thought improves relation specificity
   - *Application*: `RelationExtraction` signature design

3. **[Coreference Resolution](https://staedi.github.io/posts/coref)**
   - *Why*: To see how to use spaCy coref module
   - *Insight*: Useful but outdated needs dıscussıon

4. **[Contrastive Learning Guide](https://medium.com/@juanc.olamendy/contrastive-learning-a-comprehensive-guide-69bf23ca6b77)**
   - *Why*: Address class imbalance (ACCEPTED/REJECTED)
   - *Insight*: Triplet loss improves decision boundary clarity
   - *Application*: Alternative to standard cross-entropy

5. **[Google Patent AI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/how-ai-improves-patent-analysis)**
   - *Why*: To be ınformed about The Model
